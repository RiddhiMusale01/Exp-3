EXPERIMENT 3

AIM: To make a program with all operators

THEORY: These are basically symbols that operate on operands. There are five types of operators in c++ which is also used in the codes

arithmetic operator (+,-,*,/,%,++,--). these are the basic mathematical operators
assigment operator(=,+=,-=,*=,/=). these are used to assign value
comparision operator (==,<=,>=,!=). these are relational operators
logical operator (&&,||,!). these are to combine conditional statements

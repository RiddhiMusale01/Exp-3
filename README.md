# Exp-3,4
EXPERIMENT 3,4

AIM: To study and implement operators and bitwise operators in C++

THEORY: These are basically symbols that operate on operands. There are five types of operators in c++ which is also used in the codes

1.arithmetic operator (+,-,*,/,%,++,--). these are the basic mathematical operators
2.assigment operator(=,+=,-=,*=,/=). these are used to assign value
3.comparision operator (==,<=,>=,!=). these are relational operators
4.logical operator (&&,||,!). these are to combine conditional statements
5.bitwise opertor (&,|,^,-,<<,>>). bit level operations
